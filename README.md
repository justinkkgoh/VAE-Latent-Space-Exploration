# VAE-Latent-Space-Exploration
This repo is my attempt to recreate the preprocessing steps and training of a VAE as outlined in the IEEE research paper "Examining the Size of the Latent Space of Convolutional Variational Autoencoders Trained with Spectral Topographic Maps of EEG Frequency Bands"

This project is a work in progress. 

This is primarily done using Google Colab. Preprocessing is performed in "EEG_preprocessing.ipynb", training is done in "VAE_training.ipynb"
